depmap
======

Scans C++ files for #includes and outputs a graph of dependencies.  Can
resolve external dependencies if the search path is set and the correct filter
is set.  

Is hardcoded to search for *.cpp *.h *.tcc in the provided directory/directories
or the current path if none were provided.

If importing into yEd, first have yEd auto-size the nodes to fit their text,
then have it auto-layout the graph (heirarchical).

./depmap.sh  [-b <base>]  [-d <directory>]  [-s local|global|all]  [-f graphml|tgf|dot|txt]  [-I <search-path>]

  - Scan cpp/h/tcc files in <directory> tree(s) for #includes
  - Apply filter
  - Transform paths to be relative to <base> (for files within <base>)
  - Dump data as graph using given output format

  * <directory> defaults to the current directory if none are specified
  * <base> defaults to the first <directory> if not specified
  * <format> defaults to 'txt' if not specified
  * <scope> defaults to 'local' if not specified


 Filters
  - local is all "#include" with quoted filenames which are found
  - global is "#include" and also <#include> which are found in search path
  - all is all #include, even ones which cannot be found

 Formats
  - graphml is GraphML
  - tgf is Trivial Graph Format
  - dot is DOT format
  - txt is plain format file=dep1,...depN

 Requires recent versions of bash & realpath, awk, perl
